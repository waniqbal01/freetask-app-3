# Production readiness checklist

- **Environment variables**
  - `DATABASE_URL` points to production Postgres
  - `JWT_SECRET` is strong and non-empty; `JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES_IN`/`JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN` set per policy
  - `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` set to the externally reachable API URL (e.g. `https://api.example.com`)
  - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` lists exact front-end origins (web, Flutter web, desktop wrappers)
  - `PORT` configured for your runtime; `NODE_ENV=production`
- **Networking & proxy**
  - If running behind a proxy/load balancer, ensure forwarded headers are correct; `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` avoids Host spoofing for uploads.
  - CORS matches your deployed hosts; include mobile webviews/desktop origins if applicable.
- **Uploads & static files**
  - Mount/persist the `uploads/` directory (or map to object storage/CDN) so files survive restarts.
  - Ensure reverse proxy serves `/uploads/*` directly if offloading.
- **Database & migrations**
  - Run `npx prisma migrate deploy` against production DB.
  - Seed script is for development only; run with `SEED_FORCE=true` in non-production environments or on first-time staging data loads.
- **Monitoring & logging**
  - Enable application logs and monitor for 401/403 spikes.
  - Set up backups for the database and uploaded files.
- **Business rules**
  - Job creation minimums aligned across API and Flutter (`description >= 10 characters`, `amount >= RM1.00`) via shared constants.
